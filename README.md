A plugin for [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to support publishing packages
to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
with [yarn@berry](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry) and later. Inspired by [@suin's](https://github.com/suin)
package of a [similar name](https://github.com/suin/semantic-release-yarn).

Some benefits to using this `yarn@berry` plugin include being able to change the `package.json` version without
publishing the package to npm and being able to publish to different registries - including Azure DevOps by using
npmAuthIdent instead of npmAuthToken.

| Step               | Description                                                                                                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `verifyConditions` | Verify the presence of the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable and verify the authentication method is valid. |
| `prepare`          | Update the `package.json` version and [create](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/pack) the npm package tarball.      |
| `publish`          | [Publish the npm package](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/npm/publish) to the registry.                            |

## Install

```bash
$ yarn add -D @dmeents/semantic-release-yarn
```

## Usage

Start by adding the plugin to
the [semantic-release configuration file](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration):

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "@dmeents/semantic-release-yarn"
  ]
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable       | Required (one of) | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NPM_TOKEN      | ✅                 | **Required if** the option useNpmToken is set to true. The npm token to use to publish to the registry. It must be created using two-factor authentication [auth-only](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-two-factor-authentication) because semantic-release won't work with anything else |
| NPM_AUTH_IDENT | ✅                 | **Required if** the option useNpmAuthIdent is set to true. The npm token to use to publish to the registry. This is helpful if working with AzureDevOps for example where there is no npmAuthToken                                                                                    |

### Configuration

> Packages will be published to the registry specified in the package.json file, if none is found it will be look for
> one
> in the .yarnrc.yml file

> Your repository must be using `yarn@berry` and have a `.yarnrc.yml` file.

| Option          | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-----------------|----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| npmPublish      | ❌        | true    | Should the package be published to the registry provided in the `package.json` file.                                                                                                                                     |
| tarballDir      | ❌        | .       | The location and filename of where to output the tarball generated by Yarn. As an example, this can be used to include the tarball in the [@semantic-release/github](https://github.com/semantic-release/github) plugin. |
| changeVersion   | ❌        | true    | Determines if the plugin should update the `package.json` file as part of the `Prepare` step.                                                                                                                            |
| useNpmToken     | ❌        | true    | Determines if the plugin should use the NPM_TOKEN environment variable                                                                                                                                                   |
| useNpmAuthIdent | ❌        | false   | Determines if the plugin should use the NPM_AUTH_IDENT environment variable                                                                                                                                              |

### Example

In this example we are using this plugin to simply generate the tarball with npm and releasing it with GitHub. We are
also not allowing the plugin to update the version in the `package.json`.

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    [
      "@dmeents/semantic-release-yarn",
      {
        "npmPublish": false,
        "changeVersion": false,
        "tarballDir": "dist"
      }
    ],
    [
      "@semantic-release/github",
      {
        "assets": "dist/*.tgz"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

When wanting to publish to a registry that requires `npmAuthIdent`, for example to a private Azure DevOps feed, you need
to tell the plugin to `useNpmAuthIdent`.

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    [
      "@dmeents/semantic-release-yarn",
      {
        "npmPublish": true,
        "useNpmToken": false,
        "useNpmAuthIdent": true
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```
